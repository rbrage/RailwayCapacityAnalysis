##Introduction
The motivation to do an analysis of the railway capacity, on SÃ¸rlandsbanen, is to see how a two path railway will improve the capacity. Its also interesting to see if it is necessary to have a two path railway all the way from Stavanger to Drammen. Analyse form 2012 shows that the railway utilization capacity is larger than 85% in the peak-hour, and path for Sandes to Egersund is also larger than 85% over 24h. With the growing traffic of passenger and freight, the railway system needs to optimize its capacity to be able to handle the growing traffic.
With a simulation of the railway in Petri-Nets Model and GPenSIM, comparisons can be made between different solution of the railway infrastructure. Bottlenecks along the path can be identified and disseminated for maximum utilization of railways. Through this proposal we will explain closer what motivates for such an analysis and how we will work on analysing this problem.
